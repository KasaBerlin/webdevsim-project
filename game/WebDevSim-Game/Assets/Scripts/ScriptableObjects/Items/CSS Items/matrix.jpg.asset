    textResponse: "A background image was added to the website\r\n        \r\nThe
      Website looks now way better, right?\r\nUnfortunately our h1 is hard to read.
      Luckily we can change this.\r\nAs we focus on our h1, which looks inside of
      the CSS like this:\r\nh1{ }.\r\nFirst we could do, to make the h1 more readable,
      is to change its color.\r\nWe write inside h1{ } just color: and name a color
      like cyan, yellow or magenta.\r\nTry some different colors and see what fits
      best."
