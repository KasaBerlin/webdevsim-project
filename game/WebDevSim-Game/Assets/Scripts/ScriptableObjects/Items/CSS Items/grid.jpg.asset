    textResponse: "A background image was added to the website\r\n        \r\nThe
      Website looks now way better, right?\r\nUnfortunately the <color=#ec6463>h1</color>
      is hard to read. Luckily we can change this.\r\nSo now we focus on our h1, which
      inside of the CSS looks like this:\r\n<color=#ec6463>h1{ }</color>.\r\nFirst
      we could do is to make the h1 more readable, so we\u2019re change its color.\r\nWe
      write inside h1{ } just <color=#ec6463>color:</color> and name a color like
      cyan, yellow or magenta. A Hash code also works.\r\nTry some different colors
      and see what fits best."
