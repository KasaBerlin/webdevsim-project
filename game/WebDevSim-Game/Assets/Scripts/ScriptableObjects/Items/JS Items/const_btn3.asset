    textResponse: "const button3 was added to the main.js\n\nyes we did it, we have
      now references to the images and buttons.\nOn to the real programming. The first
      function we write will refer to the first image,\r\nwhich will goes like this:\r\n\r\nwith
      the command <color=#ec6463>code</color>  <color=#ec6463>button1.addEventListener(\"click\",()=>{image.src=\"images/imageName.jpg\")};</color>
      \nbutton1 refers to fishes.jpg.\r\nbutton2 refers to fox.jpg.\nbutton3 refers
      to monkey.jpg\n\nThe <color=#ec6463>addEventListener</color> waits for you to
      act on the website and is an essential for all the interactions on any website.\r\nFor
      our Text we use the command \u201C<color=#ec6463>code</color>\u201D for programming
      before the code.\r\nI know it\u2019s long, but you\u2019ll make it. Take your
      time and check it before submit it.\r"
