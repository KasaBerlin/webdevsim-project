    textResponse: "added Event to button3. Button3 can show monkey.jpg.\n\nall buttons
      are now interactable. We got our Gallery done. Try it out.\n\nWe could do many
      more things for the Website but that is everything for the basics of creating
      a website. I hope WebDevSim has taught you everything to make a real website,
      made all by yourself. What is left is to finish the game. Why not by typing
      \u201C<color=#ec6463>finish</color>\u201D.\n"
