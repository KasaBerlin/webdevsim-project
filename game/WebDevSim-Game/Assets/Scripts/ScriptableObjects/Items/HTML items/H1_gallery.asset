    textResponse: "you added a headline to your website.\r\n \nNoticed something new
      on the page? We come back later to it and make it more readalbe.\r\nWhat a Gallery
      needs are Images. Let\u2019s add 3 Images to the Gallery.\nAdding an Image is
      a little different as adding a \"main\" or a \"h1\".\r\nWe type <img_src=\"images/imageName.jpg\">.
      Note: \u201C_\u201D is usually a space,\r\nwe use it here only in the game.\r\nThe
      \"src\", the source, is the path of the image where it is saved locally on your
      Computer. A few images were provided for you to use. Replace the \u201CimageName.jpg\u201D
      with one of the names of the images.\r\nImages: \r\nfishes.jpg\r\nfox.jpg\r\r\nmonkey.jpg\r\n\nyou
      can use the command \"check\" to see if enough images are added."
